Well, when you are bored, and alone, may be [2](2.md) due to [1](1.md) you want to loose time, while not loosing sanity. So, there is this Hindu festival of Diwali, and I wanted to say : "Happy Diwali!". But that would be done by anyone. I abhor to fall in majority category.

So, I wanted to encode the "Happy Diwali!" greetings to Ook! or BrainFuck lingo.
Lots of interpreter are already available, but not encoders. So I wrote on in Java, as in Java there is none available.
